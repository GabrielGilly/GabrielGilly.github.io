        <h1>Documenting my journey</h1>
        <date>2021-05-06</date>
        <p>Why starting a blog in 2021? It can seam out of place in the age of youtube and podcast. 
          While most people enjoy their content with more passive media I find a lot more productive to read actual text.
          <br>
          The trues is that this blog is not even meant to be read by anyone, 
          I simply want to document my journey and if it can provide some usefull information to anyone then it is a bonus.
        </p>
        <h2>The begining</h2>
        <p>In 2019 I started to have an idea, a tiny idea: <quote>Why not changing career</quote>. 
          This tiny idea came from the fact that I always wanted to learn to code but actualy never really started. 
          I left this tiny idea at the back of my mind for a year, then it came to me again in the moment when work got hard and I questionned my life choices.
          It is interesting how a small tought we had years ago can grow into something almost obscessive.
          <br>
          I tried to push this idea again and again saying to myself <quote>You need to focus on what you are doing now</quote>. 
          But I could not remove this idea from my head, it even started to get clearer:<quote>Why not learning to code and make it my new career</quote>.
          I started reading about people starting to learn code and how you can become a develloper if you work hard enough.
          It's easy to find a lot of information about the subject on internet, too much to be honest.
        </p>

        <h2>Where to start ?</h2>
        <p>I didn't know where to start and a google search do not really answer the question. 
          So I started looking on forums and reddit, I found sub reddit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/">r/learnprogramming</a> 
          that provide a pretty <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq" target="_blank"> list</a> of questions on the subject.
          But the programing world is vast so first I needed to pick a language (C C++ c# python PHP Java Swift .NET ... 
          <br>
          I picked html and css to start easy and because I wanted to create visual quickly as data visualisation is something I do everyday for my current job.
          I started on FREECODECAMP because you could jump right in the code, but I need an introduction to the subject so I bought a book "Head First HTML CSS".
          It was usefull to just get into it at first, but clearly the book was just scratching the paint so I got back to FREECODECAMP.
          <br>
          My progression on the first module was really quick as the exercice where mostly just the immediate repetition of the lessons.
          But to finish the module I had to create some website by my own and it really got me hooked. 
          The process of facing a problem and looking for the solution myself is really what I like.
          The satisfaction to solve a problem just by using your brain never get old.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Failing to plan is planning to fail</h2>
        <p>
          After spending a few months doing tuto and exercices here an there I realised that I was not progressing. 
          I was jumping from a method to another and alwasy doing the basics exercices and lessons so I had to change this.
          Everytime I want to achive a goal I use the method describe in <a href="https://12weekyear.com/" target="_blank">The 12 weeks year</a>.
          <br>
          The method is simple:
          <ol>
            <li>Clarify your vision</li>
            <li>Set challengin goals for the next 12 weeks interval</li>
            <li>List all the deliverable you need to achieve this goal</li>
            <li>Spilt this deliverables into actionable tasks</li>
            <li>Plan the tasks over the 12 weeks</li>
          </ol>
          This methods brings me a few benefit:
          <ul>
            <li>It stops me to chage my plan every other day</li>
            <li>It make clear what is the next action to put focus on</li>
            <li>It gives me confidence that I'm aiming for my goal everyday</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
