        <h1>Documenting my journey</h1>
        <date>2021-05-06</date>
        <p>Why starting a blog in 2021? It can seam out of place in the age of YouTube and podcast. 
          While most people enjoy their content with amore passive attitude, I am more confortable to read actual text.
          <br>
          The truth is that this blog is not even meant to be read by anyone, 
          I simply want to document my journey and if it can provide some useful information to anyone then it is a bonus.
        </p>
        <h2>The begining</h2>
        <p>In 2019, I started to have an idea, a tiny idea: <quote>Why not changing career</quote>. 
          This tiny idea came from the fact that I always wanted to learn to code but actually never really started. 
          I left this tiny idea at the back of my mind for a year, then it came to me again in the moments when work gets hard. 
          You know the kind of momments when you start to question your life choices.
          It is interesting how a small thought we had years ago can slowly grow into something almost obscessive.
          <br>
          I tried to push this idea again and again saying to myself <quote>"You need to focus on what you are doing now"</quote>. 
          But I could not remove it from my mind, it even started to get clearer:<quote>Why not learning to code for couple of years and then make it my new career</quote>.
          I started reading about people making the jump to learn code and how they became develloper.
          It's easy to find a lot of information about the subject on the internet, too easy to find way way too much information...
        </p>

        <h2>Where to start ?</h2>
        <p>I didn't know where to start and a Google search do not really answer the question. 
          So I started looking on forums and Reddit, I found this sub Reddit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/">r/learnprogramming</a> 
          that provide a pretty good <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq" target="_blank"> list</a> of questions and answers on the subject.
          But the programming world is vast, so first you need to pick a language (C C++ c# python PHP Java Swift .NET ... )
          <br>
          I picked html and css to start easy and because I wanted to create visual quickly as data visualisation is something I do every day for my current job.
          I started on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">FREECODECAMP</a> because you can jump right in the code and really see what it looks like to code.
          But I needed a more structured introduction to the subject so I bought a book "Head First HTML CSS".
          It was useful to get into it at first, but clearly the book was just scratching the surface so I got back to FREECODECAMP.

          My progression on the first module was really quick as the exercise where mostly just the immediate repetition of the lessons.
          But to finish the module you need to create some website by your own and it really got me hooked. 
          The process of facing a problem and looking for the solution yourself is really what I like.
          The satisfaction to solve a problem just by yourself get old.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Failing to plan is planning to fail</h2>
        <p>
          After spending a few months doing tuto and exercices here an there I realised that I was not progressing. 
          I was jumping from a method to another and alwasy doing the basics exercices and lessons so I had to change this.
          Everytime I want to achive a goal I use the method describe in <a href="https://12weekyear.com/" target="_blank">The 12 weeks year</a>.
          <br>
          The method is simple:
          <ol>
            <li>Clarify your vision</li>
            <li>Set challengin goals for the next 12 weeks interval</li>
            <li>List all the deliverable you need to achieve this goal</li>
            <li>Spilt this deliverables into actionable tasks</li>
            <li>Plan the tasks over the 12 weeks to have a continues workload</li>
          </ol>
          <img src="assets/12_week_plan.png" alt="12 weeks plan workload"><br>

          This methods brings me a few benefit:
          <ul>
            <li>It stops me to chage my plan every other day</li>
            <li>It make clear what is the next action to put focus on</li>
            <li>It gives me confidence that I'm aiming for my goal everyday</li>
          </ul>
          I needed to make sense of all the information and learning ressources I found on the internet. So I buil my very own roadmap using my recently acquiered skills. 
          Pedagogie is the art of repetition so you can find more than 1 ressources for the same thing (ex: html video + FFC + W3 + CS50). 
          The sources of my roadmap are availaible on this <a href="https://github.com/GabrielGilly/Web_dev_roadmap">GITHUB</a>
