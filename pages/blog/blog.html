        <h1>Documenting my journey</h1>
        <p>Why starting a blog in 2021? It can seam out of place in the age of youtube and podcast. 
          While most people enjoy their content with more passive media I find a lot more productive to read actual text.
          <br>
          The trues is that this blog is not even meant to be read by anyone, 
          I simply want to document my journey and if it can provide some usefull information to anyone then it is a bonus.</p>
        <h2>The begining</h2>
        In 2019 I started to have an idea, a tiny idea: <quote>Why not changing career</quote>. 
        This tiny idea came from the fact that I always wanted to learn to code but actualy never really started. 
        I left this tiny idea at the back of my mind for a year, then it came to me again in the moment when work got hard and I questionned my life choices.
        It is interesting how a small tought we had years ago can grow into something almost obscessive.
        <br>
        I tried to pushed this idea again and again saying to myself <quote>You need to focus on what you are doing now</quote>. 
        But I could not remove this idea from my head, it even started to get clearer:<quote>Why not learning to code and make it my new career</quote>.
        I started reading about people starting to learn code and how you can become a develloper if you work hard enough.
